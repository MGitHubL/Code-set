A paper: **Network Representation Learning Algorithm Based on Neighborhood Influence Sequence**




We are sorry that due to COVID-19, we have lost the final version of the code and data. 

If you want to read or cite our code, you can refer to another paper of ours with a similar architecture: **Aggregate Global and Local Influences on Temporal Networks via Inductive Network Representation Learning (AGLI)**
